# How to play

- Starting off with selecting a sequence value from the first row, you alternate selecting sequence values from a row or a column
- Total of 8 moves to match all sequences generated from a 5x5 matrix
- In order to progress on a sequence, you must select the next value in the sequence.
  - Example: Sequence is ["A5" "CF" "13"]. If you have selected ["A5" "CF"], selecting "13" completes the sequence, OR selecting "CF" retains your position. Selecting any other value resets your position and you must restart by selecting "A5" again.
